The error you're seeing (`FileNotFoundError: [WinError 2]`) suggests that Whisper is attempting to use a program or tool (likely **FFmpeg**) to process the audio, but it can't find it in your system's `PATH`.

### üõ†Ô∏è Solution: Install FFmpeg

You need to install FFmpeg, which is required for audio processing in Whisper.

#### Step 1: **Install FFmpeg on Windows**

1. **Download FFmpeg**:  
   Go to [FFmpeg official download page](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html) and download the Windows version (usually under "Windows builds from gyan.dev").

2. **Extract the files**:
   - Extract the downloaded ZIP file to a folder, e.g., `C:\ffmpeg`.

3. **Add FFmpeg to System PATH**:
   - Open **System Properties** (`Win + R`, then type `sysdm.cpl`).
   - Go to the **Advanced** tab and click **Environment Variables**.
   - Under **System variables**, find the **Path** variable and click **Edit**.
   - Add the path to the `bin` folder of FFmpeg (e.g., `C:\ffmpeg\bin`).

4. **Verify FFmpeg Installation**:
   Open a new command prompt (`cmd`) and type:

   ```bash
   ffmpeg -version
   ```

   If installed correctly, it should show FFmpeg version details.

---

#### Step 2: **Restart your Python script**

Once FFmpeg is installed and in your system's `PATH`, restart your Python script, and it should work without the `FileNotFoundError`.
