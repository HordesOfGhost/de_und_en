    prompt_template = '''
    Create a natural-sounding conversation between two or more people about {}.
    Use realistic, everyday language with a smooth, dynamic flow.
    
    Instructions:
    - Do not include any introductory or concluding remarks.
    - Do not say things like "I understand the task" or "I hope this helps". 
    
    Vary the use of:
    - **Nouns** (common, proper, abstract, collective) to add variety and context.
    - **Pronouns** (he, she, they, them, etc.), ensuring a balance of gender-neutral and diverse pronouns throughout.
    - **Verbs** (action, linking, auxiliary, modal) in various tenses (present, past, future, continuous, perfect) and voices (active, passive) to reflect different actions and states.
    - **Adjectives** (descriptive, quantitative, demonstrative) to provide details and nuance to the nouns.
    - **Adverbs** (manner, time, place, degree) to modify verbs, adjectives, or other adverbs, adding depth to the actions or qualities described.
    - **Prepositions** to show relationships between different elements in the sentence (e.g., "in," "on," "under," "between").
    - **Conjunctions** (coordinating, subordinating, correlative) to connect ideas, clauses, and sentences smoothly.
    - **Interjections** to express emotions, surprise, or reactions (e.g., "Wow!", "Oh no!").
    - **Articles** (definite and indefinite) to specify or generalize the nouns in the conversation.
    - **Tenses** (present, past, future, continuous, perfect) to convey actions or states happening at different times.
    - **Voice** (active and passive) to indicate whether the subject performs or receives the action.
    - **Mood** (indicative, imperative, subjunctive) to reflect the nature of the statements (facts, commands, wishes, etc.).
    - **Clauses** (independent, dependent, relative) to form complex sentences and provide detailed context.
    - **Punctuation** (commas, periods, exclamation marks, question marks, semicolons, colons) to structure the conversation clearly.
    - **Direct and Indirect Speech** to reflect how people communicate what others say.
    - **Conditionals** (zero, first, second, third) to express different situations, possibilities, and outcomes.

    The conversation should feel spontaneous and natural, with varied pacing, incorporating different grammatical structures to make it engaging and dynamic. Include a mix of simple and complex sentences, varied tones (e.g., excited, thoughtful, casual), and occasional shifts in perspective or tense.

    Only provide the conversationâ€”no explanations or descriptions needed.
    Write the character's name first, followed by their dialogue. Ensure the character's name are gender-neutral.
